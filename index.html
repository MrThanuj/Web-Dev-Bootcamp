    <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the <a
            href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet>Internet (World Wide Web)</a> or an intranet (a
        private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
        complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks
        to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,
        client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
        development.

        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites:
        writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes
        easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>

    <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
    <h4>Origin/ Web 1.0</h4>
    <p>im Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.[5]

        The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of
        academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in
        1993.[6]

        Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of
        information.[7] Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.[8]</p>

    <h4>Web 2.0</h4>
    <p>Web 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with
        Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.[9][10]

        Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only nature of
        Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a
        user-focused, read-write online network.[7]

        In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities
        such as creating music, files, images, and movies.[11] The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the
        "backbone of the internet," using standardized XML (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize information
        flow from independent platforms and online databases.[7]</p>

    <h4>Web 3.0</h4>
    <p>Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a
        complete redesign of the web. Key features include the integration of metadata, precise information delivery,
        and improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and interests.[citation needed]

        Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than traditional
        search engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve
        identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.[7]

        This version is sometimes also known as Semantic Web.[12]</p>
